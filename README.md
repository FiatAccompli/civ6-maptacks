# Map Tacks 1.0.0 [<img align="right" src="maptacks.png" height="256" width="256">](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122081356)
Adds new map icons  
Enhances list interface  
Fixes bugs and styling  

## New icons
The map tack editor adds many new icons:

* districts, customized with civilization unique districts
* improvements, including unique & bonus improvements from civilization
  abilities, city states, and governors
* unit actions like harvesting, repair, archaeology, and espionage
* scouting markers for barbarian outposts and tribal villages
* all types of great people, and
* a golden tile to mark wonder sites

All new icons have tooltips, with game effects for districts and improvements.

## Scrollable map pin list
The list dynamically resizes to show up to 15 map tacks, with a scrollbar to
manage longer lists. It groups all named locations at the top, followed by all
unnamed locations in numerical order.

## Bug fixes and restyling
The mod fixes a few base-game bugs and styling problems: The pin list will no
longer grow past the top of the screen. Unnamed pins now sort correctly when
there are more than ten. Labels and controls have more consistent alignment and
spacing.

## Compatibility
The Map Tacks mod does not affect saved games, so you can add it to a game in
progress or disable it without breaking your game. It overrides any map pin
features in other UI mods. Map Tacks is compatible with Unique District Icons,
and uses the unique icons for districts.
